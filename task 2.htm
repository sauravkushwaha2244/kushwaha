    <h1>Article on the GST 2.0</h1>
    <p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) 2.0 is an important reform in the Indian taxation system. It aims to simplify the tax structure and make compliance easier for businesses.Simplified GST Structure
GST 2.0 replaces the earlier four-slab system (5%, 12%, 18%, and 28%) with just two principal slabs: 5% for essentials and 18% for most goods and services.

Essentials like daily-use items, food grains, medicines, and many consumer goods are taxed at 5%.

Most other goods and services (including manufacturing and telecom) now fall under the 18% slab.

Ultra-luxury and sin goods—tobacco, pan masala, aerated drinks, premium cars—are taxed at 40%.

Key Benefits and Rate Reductions
Daily essentials such as soaps, shampoos, toothpaste, tableware, bicycles, juices, chocolates, diapers, and biscuits now attract 5% GST, instead of 12–18%.

Critical healthcare relief: GST dropped to nil on 33 lifesaving drugs, select cancer treatments, and rare-disease medications.

Life and health insurance policies are now GST-exempt, making financial protection affordable for many families.
